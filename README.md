## Object Tracking with Mobile Vehicle
This project involves developing a system for object tracking using a mobile vehicle. The system uses a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, and a Maestro Motor Driver to track an object based on its color and control the vehicle's movement accordingly. The project was developed as part of an experiment in the Electronics and Communications Engineering department at the University of Kocaeli.

## Experiment Results
# Observations and Graphs
- Object Location: Detect the location of a specific color object in the image and visualize it with a bounding box.
- Object Area: Calculate and display the area occupied by the detected object.
- Motor Responses: Observe the state (forward, reverse, stop) and power levels (duty cycle) of the motors based on the object's position and size.
# Data to be Recorded
- Object Coordinates: x and y coordinates of the object relative to the screen center.
- Bounding Box Area: Width and height of the bounding box surrounding the object.
- Motor States and Power Levels: Working state and applied power levels of each motor.
# Sampling Time
- Video Frame Rate: The system operates at 32 FPS (frames per second).
- Data Recording Timing: x and y coordinates, object area, and motor states are recorded for each frame.
